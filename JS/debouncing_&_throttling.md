## Debouncing
Debouncing is a programming pattern or a technique to restrict the calling of a time-consuming function frequently, by delaying the execution of the function until a specified time to avoid unnecessary CPU cycles, and API calls and improve performance.
- Implementation
Letâ€™s say you want to show suggestions for a search query, but only after a visitor has finished typing it.
  ```
  <input type="text" onkeyup="processChange()" />
  
  ```

Throttling is used to call a function after every millisecond or a particular interval of time only the first click is executed immediately.
