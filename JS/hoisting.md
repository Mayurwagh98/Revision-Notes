## hoisting

JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

1. Being able to use a variable's value in its scope before the line it is declared. ("Value hoisting")
2. Being able to reference a variable in its scope before the line it is declared, without throwing a ReferenceError, but the value is always undefined. ("Declaration hoisting")
3. The declaration of the variable causes behavior changes in its scope before the line in which it is declared.
