## Closures

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

```
function init() {
  var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, that forms the closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```
init() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().

-----------------------------------------------
1. Closures are an ability of a function to remember the variables and functions that are declared in its outer scope.
```
var Person = function(pName){
  var name = pName;

  this.getName = function(){
    return name;
  }
}

var person = new Person("Neelesh");
console.log(person.getName());
```
```
function randomFunc(){
  var obj1 = {name:"Vivian", age:45};

  return function(){
    console.log(obj1.name + " is "+ "awesome"); // Has access to obj1 even when the randomFunc function is executed

  }
}

var initialiseClosure = randomFunc(); // Returns a function

initialiseClosure(); 
```
