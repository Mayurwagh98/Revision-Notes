## Diff between `undefined` and `null`

| null  | undefined |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 	It is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable which indicates that a variable does not point any object.  | It is not an assignment value. It means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.  |
| The null value is a primitive value which represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference.  | The undefined value is a primitive value, which is used when a variable has not been assigned a value.  |
| Null indicates the absence of a value for a variable.  |  Undefined indicates the absence of the variable itself.  |
| Null is converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations.  | Undefined is converted to NaN while performing primitive operations.  |

* `udefined == null` // true
* `undefined === null` // false
