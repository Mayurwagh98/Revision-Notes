## JSON
- What is JSON?
1. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format
2. JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation
3. JSON is used to send data between computers
4. JSON is language independent

- This example is a JSON string:
```
  '{"name":"John", "age":30, "car":null}'
```
- Why Use JSON?
1. The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.
2. Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.
3. JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
```
  JSON.parse()
```
4. JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
  ```
  JSON.stringify()
  ```
