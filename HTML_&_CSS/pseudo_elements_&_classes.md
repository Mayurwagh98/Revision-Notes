Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are selectors in CSS that allow you to target specific parts of an HTML element or its state without the need for additional markup.

Pseudo-elements are used to style a specific part of an element's content, and they are represented by a double colon (::) before the selector. 

Some common pseudo-elements include:

1. `::before`: Used to insert content before the content of an element.

2. `::after`: Used to insert content after the content of an element.

3. `::first-letter`: Used to style the first letter of the first line of a block-level element.

4. `::first-line`: Used to style the first line of a block-level element.

Pseudo-classes, on the other hand, are used to style an element based on its state or position in the document tree, and they are represented by a single colon (:) before the selector. 

Some common pseudo-classes include:

1. `:hover`: Used to style an element when the mouse pointer hovers over it.

2. `:active`: Used to style an element when it is being clicked or tapped.

3. `:visited`: Used to style a link that has been visited.

4. `:nth-child(n)`: Used to style an element that is the nth child of its parent.

5. `:focus`: Used to style an element when it is in focus, such as when a form field is selected.
