1. In web design and development, the box model is a concept used to describe how HTML elements are laid out and how their size and position are calculated.
2. Each HTML element is represented as a rectangular box that consists of four layers: content, padding, border, and margin. These layers are represented as follows:
  - Content: The innermost layer of the box, which contains the actual content of the element, such as text or images.
  - Padding: A transparent area that surrounds the content and provides space between the content and the border. Padding can be set using the CSS padding property.
  - Border: A line that surrounds the padding and content of the box. Borders can be styled using the CSS border property.
  - Margin: A transparent area that surrounds the border and provides space between the element and other elements on the page. Margins can be set using the CSS margin property.
```
<div class="box">
  <p>Some text inside the box.</p>
</div>
```
```
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 10px;
}
```
