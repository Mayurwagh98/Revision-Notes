1. Flexbox, or "Flexible Box Layout," is a CSS layout module that provides a more efficient way to create flexible and responsive layouts for web pages. 
2. It allows you to create flexible containers and align and distribute the space among the items within them, regardless of their size or order.
3. With flexbox, you can easily arrange elements in a row or column, adjust their size, and align them vertically or horizontally within a container. It provides a powerful set of properties that can be used to control the layout, including:
  - display: Specifies whether an element is a flex container or a flex item.
  - flex-direction: Specifies the direction of the flex container, either row or column.
  - flex-wrap: Specifies whether the flex items should wrap to a new row or column when they exceed the size of the container.
  - justify-content: Specifies how the flex items should be aligned horizontally within the container.
  - align-items: Specifies how the flex items should be aligned vertically within the container.
  - align-content: Specifies how the space between rows or columns should be distributed within the container.
