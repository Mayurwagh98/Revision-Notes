1. In HTML, an event listener is a programming construct that allows web developers to define code that is executed when a specific event occurs. 
2. Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as a button click, a page load, or a keyboard input.
3. Event listeners are used to detect these events and execute code in response.
4. To create an event listener in HTML, developers use JavaScript code to specify the event they want to listen for and the function that should be executed when the event occurs.
5. For example, to create an event listener for a button click, the following code can be used:
```
<button id="myButton">Click me!</button>
<script>
  document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  });
</script>
```
6. In this example, the addEventListener() method is used to add an event listener to the button with the ID myButton. The event being listened for is a click event, and the function that should be executed when the event occurs is an anonymous function that displays an alert box with the message "Button clicked!".
7. Event listeners are a fundamental part of dynamic web development and are used extensively in modern web applications to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.
