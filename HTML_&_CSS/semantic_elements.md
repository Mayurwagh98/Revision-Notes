Semantic elements in HTML are tags that provide meaning and context to the content they enclose, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the structure and purpose of the web page.

Some common semantic elements in HTML5 include:

1. `<header>`: Defines the top part of a web page or section.
2. `<nav>`: Defines a set of navigation links.
3. `<main>`: Defines the main content of a web page or section.
4. `<article>`: Defines a self-contained content section, such as a blog post or news article.
5. `<section>`: Defines a group of related content.
6. `<aside>`: Defines content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as a sidebar.
7. `<footer>`: Defines the bottom part of a web page or section.
