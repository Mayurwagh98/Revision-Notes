1. Forms in HTML are used to collect user input and send that data to a web server for processing.
2. They provide a way for users to enter data such as text, numbers, dates, and selections, and then submit that data to the server.
3. HTML forms are created using the <form> element and can include a variety of form controls such as text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, and more.
4. Each form control is represented by its own HTML element, such as <input>, <select>, or <textarea>, and can have additional attributes to specify its type, label, default value, and other properties.
5. When a user submits a form, the data entered in the form controls is packaged and sent to the web server using the HTTP POST or GET method.
6. The server-side code can then process the data and use it to generate a response or perform some action.
