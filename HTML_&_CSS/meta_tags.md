- Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata or information about a web page. 
- These tags do not affect the visual appearance of the web page, but they provide information about the page's content, author, keywords, and other information that can be used by search engines, social media platforms, and web browsers.

1. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding used on the page.

2. `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Defines the viewport size for mobile devices.

3. `<meta name="description" content="description of the page">`: Provides a short description of the web page.

4. `<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">`: Specifies a comma-separated list of keywords relevant to the page.

5. `<meta name="author" content="author name">`: Specifies the name of the author of the page.

6. `<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">`: Instructs search engines whether to index and follow links on the page.

- Meta tags are placed in the head section of the HTML document and are read by search engines, social media platforms, and web browsers to understand the content of the page and how it should be displayed.
- By using meta tags, you can improve the visibility and accessibility of your web pages.
