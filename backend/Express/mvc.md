1. MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software architectural pattern used to develop web applications.
2. The main idea behind MVC is to separate the application's data (model), user interface (view), and control flow (controller) into three distinct components.
3. The model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
4. The view is responsible for presenting the data to the user in a suitable format. It interacts with the model to retrieve the data it needs to display.
5. The controller is responsible for handling user requests and updating the model and view accordingly. It acts as a mediator between the model and the view, ensuring that they remain decoupled.
6. By separating the concerns of the application into three components, MVC makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain large-scale web applications. It also promotes reusability and modularity by allowing each component to be developed independently.
