1. A template engine is a tool or software component that helps to generate dynamic HTML pages by using templates and data. In web development, a template engine is used to separate the presentation logic (the HTML structure and layout) from the application logic (the data processing and business logic).
2. This separation allows developers to work independently on the different parts of a web application and facilitates the reuse of code.
3. A template engine works by using a template, which is a pre-designed HTML file that contains placeholders for dynamic content.
4. The template engine then takes the data from the application and merges it with the template to generate the final HTML page that is sent to the client's browser.
5. Template engines often provide a set of tools or features to make the process of creating and rendering templates more efficient, such as:
  - Conditional statements and loops for dynamic content
  - Template inheritance to reuse templates and avoid duplication
  - Filters to manipulate data before rendering it
  - Helpers to perform common tasks, such as formatting dates and numbers

### What are some templating engines?

1. `Handlebars`: Handlebars is a popular templating engine that allows you to create templates with placeholders and helpers. It's based on Mustache and supports partials, conditionals, and loops.
2. `Pug (formerly known as Jade)`: Pug is a high-performance templating engine that uses indentation to define HTML structure. It supports mixins, includes, and filters.
3. `EJS (Embedded JavaScript)`: EJS is a simple templating engine that uses embedded JavaScript code to generate HTML. It supports partials and loops and has a syntax similar to HTML.
4. `Nunjucks`: Nunjucks is a powerful templating engine that supports inheritance, macros, and asynchronous rendering. It has a syntax similar to Jinja2 and Twig.
5. `Twig`: Twig is a popular templating engine for PHP that has been ported to JavaScript. It has a syntax similar to Jinja2 and supports filters, functions, and macros.
6. `Mustache`: Mustache is a minimalistic templating engine that uses a simple syntax to define placeholders. It supports conditionals and loops and has implementations in many programming languages.
7.`Haml`: Haml is a concise templating engine that uses indentation to define HTML structure. It supports filters and mixins and has a syntax similar to Ruby.
