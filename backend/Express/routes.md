1. Routes in Express are used to define how the application responds to client requests to a specific URL and HTTP method.
2. Express provides a router object that allows you to define routes for handling different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
3. Routes are defined using the HTTP method and the path of the requested URL. For example, to handle a GET request to the /users URL, you can define a route like this:
```
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // handle the request
})
```
