1. Static routing in Express is used to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources from a specific directory on the server.
2. This can be useful for serving a website or web application that contains static assets.
3. To set up static routing in Express, you can use the express.static middleware function, which serves files from a specified directory. Here's an example:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the 'public' directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```
4. In this example, the express.static middleware function is used to serve files from the public directory. This means that any file located in the public directory can be accessed from the server by using its URL, for example, http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png.
5. You can also set a specific URL path for the static files by specifying a path as the first argument to the express.static function. For example:
```
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));
```
6. In this case, any file in the public directory can be accessed by using the URL http://localhost:3000/static/filename. The URL path /static is used as a prefix for all static files.
