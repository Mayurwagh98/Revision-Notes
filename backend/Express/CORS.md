1. CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is a security feature implemented in modern web browsers. It allows a web page from one domain or origin to access resources with a different domain or origin.
2. By default, web browsers enforce a same-origin policy, which means that web pages can only access resources from the same domain as the web page itself. 
3. This is done for security reasons, as it helps to prevent malicious scripts on one domain from accessing sensitive data on another domain.
4. However, there are some legitimate use cases where web pages need to access resources from other domains. For example, a JavaScript application running on one domain may need to access a REST API hosted on another domain.
5. CORS provides a standardized way for web servers to tell the browser whether or not it should allow cross-origin requests.
6. In order to enable CORS on a server, the server must send appropriate headers in response to an incoming request. Specifically, the server must send an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header that specifies the domains that are allowed to make cross-origin requests. The server can also specify additional headers such as Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers to further control the behavior of cross-origin requests.
7. It is important to configure CORS properly in order to prevent security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
