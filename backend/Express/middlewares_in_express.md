1. In Express, middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next function in the application's request-response cycle. 
2. Middleware functions can modify the request and response objects, or perform additional tasks such as logging, authentication, or error handling. Middleware functions can be used for many purposes, such as:
  - Parsing request bodies and cookies
  - Serving static files
  - Authenticating users
  - Handling errors
  - Applying security measures, such as setting headers or sanitizing user input
3. Middleware functions can be defined using the app.use() method, or using specific methods for handling different HTTP methods, such as app.get(), app.post(), etc.
4. Middleware functions are executed in the order in which they are defined, so it's important to define them in the correct order. Middleware functions can also pass control to the next middleware function using the next() function, which calls the next middleware function in the stack.
5. Here's an example of how to define a middleware function in Express:
```
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // perform middleware logic
  next()
})
```
6. In this example, the app.use() method is used to define a middleware function that takes three arguments: req (request), res (response), and next. The middleware function can perform some logic and then call the next() function to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.
7. Overall, middleware functions are a powerful mechanism for defining how the application handles requests and responses, and allow developers to add functionality to their applications in a modular and flexible way.
