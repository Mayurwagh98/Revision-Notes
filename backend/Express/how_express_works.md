1. Initialization: To use Express in your Node.js application, you need to install the express package using a package manager like npm or yarn. Once installed, you can create an Express application object by calling the express() function.
2. Middleware: Express uses middleware functions to handle requests and responses. Middleware functions are functions that take three arguments: request, response, and next. Middleware functions can modify the request and response objects, or perform additional tasks such as logging or authentication. Middleware functions are executed in the order in which they are defined.
3. Routing: Express provides a routing mechanism that allows you to define routes for handling HTTP requests. Routes are defined using methods such as get(), post(), put(), delete(), etc. Each route is associated with a handler function that is called when the route is matched.
4. Views: Express supports the use of view engines, such as EJS or Pug, to render dynamic HTML pages. View engines allow you to define templates that can be populated with dynamic data from the server.
5. Error handling: Express provides a mechanism for handling errors that occur during request processing. Error handling middleware functions can be defined to handle errors that occur in the application, such as server errors or client errors.
6. Serving static files: Express can serve static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, by defining a static directory using the express.static() function.
7. Deployment: Once your application is developed, you can deploy it to a server or cloud platform to make it available to users.
