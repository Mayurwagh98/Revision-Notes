1. `Using a validation library`: There are many validation libraries available for Express, such as express-validator, Joi, and Yup. You can use these libraries to define validation rules for incoming requests and check if the data provided by the user meets those rules. These libraries provide many built-in validation rules and also allow you to define your custom rules.
2. `Custom middleware`: You can create custom middleware functions in Express that can be used to validate incoming requests. The middleware function can check the request data and return an error response if the data is invalid. You can add this middleware function to the route that requires validation.
3. `Using route-specific validation functions`: You can also define route-specific validation functions that are executed before the main route handler function. These validation functions can be defined using the Express Router middleware function. If the validation fails, you can return an error response, and if it passes, you can call the next function in the middleware chain.
```
const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

app.post('/register', 
    body('email').isEmail(),
    body('password').isLength({ min: 6 }),
    (req, res) => {
        const errors = validationResult(req);
        if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
            return res.status(422).json({ errors: errors.array() });
        }
        // Handle registration logic here
    }
);
```
