1. Mongoose does not return a Promise by default because it predates the widespread adoption of Promises in JavaScript.
2. Instead, it provides a callback-based API that allows you to handle results asynchronously.
3. However, Mongoose provides a way to work with Promises using the exec() method. This method can be called on any query object, and it returns a Promise that resolves to the query results.
4. For example, instead of using the callback-based find() method like this:
```
MyModel.find({ name: 'John' }, function (err, docs) {
  // Handle the results here
});
```
5. You can use the exec() method to return a Promise instead:
```
MyModel.find({ name: 'John' }).exec().then(function (docs) {
  // Handle the results here
}).catch(function (err) {
  // Handle any errors here
});
```
6. The reason that Mongoose does not automatically return a Promise for all queries is that the callback-based API provides more flexibility and can be easier to work with in some cases. 
7. For example, you can use multiple callback functions to handle different types of errors or to chain queries together.
8. However, as Promises have become more popular in the JavaScript community, Mongoose has added support for Promises to provide more options for working with asynchronous code.
