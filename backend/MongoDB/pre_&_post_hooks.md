1. Pre and post hooks in Mongoose are functions that can be defined in your schema to run before or after specific events occur on a document or collection, such as a save or remove operation. Pre hooks run before the event occurs, while post hooks run after the event occurs.
2. These hooks allow you to perform custom logic or modifications to your data before or after it is saved, updated, or removed from the database. For example, you might use a pre hook to automatically set a timestamp on a document before it is saved, or a post hook to trigger a notification or update a related document after a document is removed.
3. Here is an example of defining a pre hook to automatically set a timestamp on a document before it is saved:
```
const mySchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String
});

mySchema.pre('save', function(next) {
  this.timestamp = new Date();
  next();
});
```
4. In this example, a pre hook is defined on the save event for the schema. The function passed to pre() sets the timestamp field to the current date before the document is saved. The next() function is called to indicate that the pre hook has completed and the save operation can proceed.
5. You can also define post hooks to run after specific events occur, such as a remove operation:
```
mySchema.post('remove', function(doc) {
  console.log('Document removed:', doc);
});
```
6. In this example, a post hook is defined on the remove event for the schema. The function passed to post() logs a message indicating that the document has been removed.
7. Pre and post hooks can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as validating or modifying data, triggering related actions or notifications, or enforcing complex business rules. They allow you to define custom logic that is automatically executed when specific events occur, without requiring you to manually perform the same actions in your application code.
