1. In Node.js, the event loop is responsible for handling and processing I/O operations and executing callbacks.
2. The event loop has several phases, each with its own set of tasks. Here are the different phases involved in the event loop in Node.js:
  - `Timers phase`: This phase executes the callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval() functions. The callbacks are executed in order of their scheduled time.
  - `I/O callbacks phase`: This phase executes I/O related callbacks that were deferred in the previous event loop iteration. These callbacks may include callbacks for network operations, file system operations, and other asynchronous operations.
  - `Idle, prepare phase`: This phase is used for internal operations and is usually not used in user code.
  - `Poll phase`: This phase polls for new I/O events and executes the corresponding I/O callbacks. If there are no I/O events pending, it waits until a new event arrives or until the timeout specified by setTimeout() elapses.
  - `Check phase`: This phase executes the setImmediate() callbacks that are scheduled to run immediately after the current phase.
  - `Close callbacks phase`: This phase executes the callbacks for all closed connections and resources, such as sockets and file descriptors.
3. After executing all the callbacks in the Close callbacks phase, the event loop starts over again from the beginning with the Timers phase. This cycle continues as long as there are events to process.
```
console.log('Start');

// Timers phase
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout 1');
}, 0);

// I/O callbacks phase
process.nextTick(() => {
  console.log('Next tick');
});

// Poll phase
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  console.log('File I/O');
  
  // Check phase
  setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('Immediate');
  });
});

// Close callbacks phase
const server = require('http').createServer(() => {});
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Server closed');
  });
});

console.log('End');
```
### Output
```
Start
End
Next tick
File I/O
Timeout 1
Immediate
Server listening on port 3000
Server closed
```
Here's an explanation of what's happening in each phase:
1. Timers phase: The setTimeout() function schedules a callback to be executed after 0 milliseconds. The callback is added to the Timers queue and will be executed in the next iteration of the event loop.
2. I/O callbacks phase: The process.nextTick() function schedules a callback to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, after the current phase completes.
3. Poll phase: The fs.readFile() function reads the contents of the current file and schedules a callback to be executed when the operation is complete. This callback is added to the Poll queue and will be executed in the next iteration of the event loop.
4. Check phase: The setImmediate() function schedules a callback to be executed immediately after the current phase completes. The callback is added to the Check queue and will be executed before any Timers callbacks in the next iteration of the event loop.
5. Close callbacks phase: The server.listen() function creates a HTTP server that listens on port 3000. When a client connects, the server sends a response and then closes the connection. The server.close() function schedules a callback to be executed when the server is closed. This callback is added to the Close callbacks queue and will be executed after all other phases are complete in the next iteration of the event loop.
