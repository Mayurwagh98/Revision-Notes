1. NVM stands for Node Version Manager. 
2. It is a command-line tool that allows you to easily manage multiple versions of Node.js on the same machine.
3. NVM is useful when you need to work with different Node.js projects that require different versions of Node.js.
4. Here's how you can use NVM to manage your Node.js installations:
- Install NVM: You can download and install NVM from the official repository. For example, on a Linux system, you can use the following command to download and install NVM:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```
- Install a Node.js version: Once you have NVM installed, you can use it to install a specific version of Node.js. For example, to install Node.js version 14.17.0, you can use the following command:
```
nvm install 14.17.0
```
- Use a specific Node.js version: After you have installed multiple versions of Node.js, you can use NVM to switch between them. For example, to use Node.js version 14.17.0, you can use the following command:
```
nvm use 14.17.0
```
- Set a default Node.js version: You can use NVM to set a default version of Node.js that will be used whenever you open a new terminal window. For example, to set Node.js version 14.17.0 as the default, you can use the following command:
```
nvm alias default 14.17.0
```
