1. Hashing is a process of transforming a string of characters into a fixed-size, usually hexadecimal or binary string of characters using a mathematical function. 
2. In Node.js, hashing is commonly used to secure passwords, generate digital signatures, or verify the integrity of data.
3. Node.js provides built-in support for several hash algorithms, including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. These algorithms are implemented using the crypto module, which provides a set of cryptographic functions for Node.js applications.
4. Here's an example of how to generate a SHA256 hash of a string using the crypto module in Node.js:
```
const crypto = require('crypto');

const plaintext = 'my secret message';
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(plaintext).digest('hex');

console.log(hash);
```
- In this example, we use the crypto.createHash() method to create a SHA256 hash object, which we then update with the plaintext message using the update() method.
- We then call the digest() method with the hex argument to generate a hexadecimal representation of the hash. Finally, we log the hash to the console.
