1. The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google and used in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers. 
2. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code, making it faster to execute.
3. In the context of Node.js, the V8 engine is used as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node.js is built on top of the V8 engine, which provides a high-performance execution environment for JavaScript code.
4. When Node.js executes a JavaScript file, it passes the file to the V8 engine, which compiles and executes the code.
5. The V8 engine provides several features that are useful for JavaScript developers, including:
  - `Just-in-time (JIT) compilation`: The V8 engine uses JIT compilation to optimize JavaScript code at runtime, making it faster to execute.
  - `Garbage collection`: The V8 engine automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation in a Node.js application, freeing up memory that is no longer needed.
  - `ECMAScript support`: The V8 engine implements the ECMAScript standard, providing support for modern JavaScript features and syntax.
