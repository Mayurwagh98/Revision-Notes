1. body-parser is a middleware module for Node.js that parses the body of incoming HTTP requests and makes it available in the req.body object.
2. It's commonly used in Express.js web applications to extract data submitted through HTML forms or in JSON or XML format.
3. When a client sends an HTTP request to a Node.js server, the request can contain data in the request body, such as form data, JSON data, or XML data.
4. The body-parser module provides a way to extract this data and make it available in the req.body object.
```
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const app = express();

// Parse incoming requests with JSON payloads
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Parse incoming requests with urlencoded payloads
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// Handle POST requests to the /login route
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
  const password = req.body.password;
  
  // Authenticate user credentials and return response
  // ...
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```
- In this example, we use the body-parser middleware to parse incoming HTTP requests with JSON or urlencoded payloads. We then define a route for handling POST requests to the /login endpoint. 
- When a POST request is received, the body-parser middleware extracts the data from the request body and makes it available in the req.body object.
- We can then access the username and password fields of the request body using req.body.username and req.body.password, respectively. We can then use this data to authenticate the user and return an appropriate response.
- Without using body-parser, we would need to manually parse the request body using the querystring module for urlencoded data or the JSON.parse() method for JSON data. body-parser simplifies this process and makes it easier to work with request data in Express.js applications.
