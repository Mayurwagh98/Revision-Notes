1. WebSockets are a communication protocol that enables two-way communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection.
2. This is in contrast to traditional HTTP requests and responses, which are stateless and require a new connection to be established for each request/response cycle.
3. WebSockets are designed to allow real-time, low-latency communication between a client and a server.
4. They are often used in applications such as online gaming, chat applications, and real-time data visualization.
5. The WebSocket protocol is based on the WebSocket API, which is built into modern web browsers and allows web developers to easily create applications that use WebSockets. 
6. The protocol uses a handshake process to establish a connection between the client and server, and once the connection is established, data can be sent back and forth between the two parties in real-time.
