1. Code splitting is a technique used in the MERN stack to split the JavaScript code of an application into smaller chunks or modules, which are loaded on-demand by the browser. 
2. This technique is used to optimize the performance of the application by reducing the initial load time and improving the user experience.
3. In a typical MERN application, code splitting is achieved using tools like Webpack, which analyze the code and split it into smaller modules.
4. These modules are loaded asynchronously by the browser, only when needed, instead of loading the entire code upfront.
5. For example, imagine a large MERN application that has multiple pages and components. With code splitting, each page and component can be split into separate modules, and only the modules needed for a specific page are loaded when the user navigates to that page. 
6. This approach reduces the initial load time and the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network, resulting in a faster and more responsive application.
