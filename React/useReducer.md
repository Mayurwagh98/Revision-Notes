## What does useReducer do?
1. The useReducer Hook is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.
2. useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function to which you can pass an action and later invoke it. While this is similar to the pattern Redux uses, there are a few differences.
