## State vs Props
| Props  | State |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Props are read-only.  | State changes can be asynchronous.  |
| Props are immutable. | State is mutable.  |
|Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.  |  State holds information about the components.  |
| Props can be accessed by the child component.  | State cannot be accessed by child components.  |
| Props are used to communicate between components.  | States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.  |
| Props make components reusable.  | State cannot make components reusable.  |
| Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component. | The State is internal and controlled by the React Component itself.  |
