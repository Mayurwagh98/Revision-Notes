## What is Node Js?
1. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
2. Node.js is built on top of the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. 
3. This means that developers can write server-side code using JavaScript, which was traditionally used only for front-end development.
