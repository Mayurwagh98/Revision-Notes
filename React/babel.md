1. Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 
2. Babel is a popular open-source JavaScript compiler that transforms newer versions of JavaScript code into older versions that are compatible with older browsers and environments.
3. Babel allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features, such as arrow functions, template literals, and async/await, while still ensuring that their code works on older browsers and environments that don't support those features.
4. Babel achieves this by parsing the modern JavaScript code and then transforming it into a more compatible version of JavaScript, often using polyfills to emulate missing features. 
5. Babel can be configured to target specific browsers or environments, and can also be extended with plugins to add additional functionality or transform other languages that compile to JavaScript.
6. Babel is widely used in modern web development, particularly in combination with other tools such as webpack and React, and has become an essential tool for many developers looking to build modern web applications while ensuring compatibility with older browsers and environments.
7. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
```
// Babel Input: ES2015 arrow function
[1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 1);

// Babel Output: ES5 equivalent
[1, 2, 3].map(function(n) {
  return n + 1;
});
```
