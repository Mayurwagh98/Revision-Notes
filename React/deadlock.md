1. In React, a deadlock occurs when two or more components are waiting for each other to update and neither can proceed. 
2. This can happen when two or more components have a dependency on each other's state or props and are trying to update them simultaneously.
3. For example, consider two components, A and B. Component A is waiting for an update from component B to render its new state, while component B is waiting for an update from component A to render its new state.
4. This creates a cycle where neither component can proceed, leading to a deadlock.
5. To avoid deadlocks in React, it's important to structure your components in a way that avoids circular dependencies and ensures that each component can update independently of the others.
6. You can also use tools like the React Profiler to identify and debug performance issues that may be causing deadlocks.
