1. Tree shaking is a technique used in the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack to eliminate unused code from the final bundle generated by a module bundler like Webpack.
2. It works by analyzing the code and detecting which parts of the code are not used and can be safely removed.
3. In a typical MERN application, there may be several JavaScript modules that are imported into the application but are not actually used.
4. Tree shaking identifies and eliminates these unused modules, reducing the size of the final bundle and improving the performance of the application.
5. Tree shaking is particularly useful in applications that use libraries or frameworks with many features that are not needed for the application. 
6.  By using tree shaking, developers can eliminate unused code from these libraries or frameworks, resulting in a smaller bundle size and faster application performance.
