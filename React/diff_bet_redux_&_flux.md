## Difference between Redux and Flux
https://medium.com/edge-coders/the-difference-between-flux-and-redux-71d31b118c1

| Flux  | Redux |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Multiple Stores  | Single Store  |
| Store manages logic | Reducer manages logic  |
| Flux is a pattern | Redux is a library  |
| Flux has a single dispatcher and all actions have to pass through that dispatcher.  | Redux has no dispatcher entity. Instead, the store has the dispatching process baked in. |
