## What do you mean by JSX?
1. JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript code.
```
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```
In this example, we are using JSX to create a new h1 element with the text "Hello, World!". This code will be converted by a compiler into regular JavaScript code that creates the same element using React.createElement().
```
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World!");
```
