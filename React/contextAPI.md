## What is Context API
1. The Context API helps share data between components which you canâ€™t easily share with props, for example, complex data objects.  
2. React Context API provides a way to send data like userid, auth, and theme data through the component tree without sending any props manually at every level. 
3. We can also share specific states with multiple components instead through props manually. In some use cases, ideal for theming, localization, authentication etc.
