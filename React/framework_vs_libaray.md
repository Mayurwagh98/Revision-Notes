## What is the difference between FrameWork and Library?
Framework: 
1. A framework is a software tool that provides a complete architecture or structure for building an application.
2. It often includes pre-built components, modules, and APIs that developers can use to create applications more quickly and easily.
3. Frameworks typically provide a set of rules, guidelines, and best practices for developing applications, which can make it easier for developers to write consistent, maintainable, and scalable code

Library: 
1. is a collection of reusable code that developers can use to add specific functionality to their applications. 
2. Libraries typically provide a set of functions, classes, or modules that can be imported into an application and used to perform specific tasks.
3. Libraries don't provide a complete architecture or structure for building an application, but rather offer specific functionality that can be integrated into an application as needed.
